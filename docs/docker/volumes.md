## Docker Volumes Deep Dive

> By design, Docker containers do not store persistent data. Any data written to a container's writable layer will no longer be available once the container stops running. Also, getting data written to a container back out of it for another process can be difficult. To solve the issue of persisting data from a container docker uses volumes

* `docker volume ls` command will show all volumes
* Lets create one

* Lets Create another one and inspect

* You can see those volumes mounted on `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`

* Lets attach this volume to a new container. (`-v vikivol:/vol` and `--mount source=<vol_name>,target=<cont_mnt_dir>` are same however mount is preferred)

* Now lets look into the volume. the Host machines directory is actually mounted into the container

* This volume is persitent. even if you delete the container the volume with data will persist
* If you try to delete a volume which is being used by a container it will not be deleted thats a safety latch.
